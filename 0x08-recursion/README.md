Recursion is a technique that allows a function to call itself repeatedly until a base case is reached. Recursion can be useful for solving problems that have a recursive structure, such as fractals, tree traversal, or Fibonacci sequence. 🌳🌀🐇

However, recursion also has some drawbacks, such as the risk of stack overflow, memory consumption, and difficulty in debugging. Therefore, it is important to use recursion wisely and carefully, and to compare it with other possible solutions, such as iteration or dynamic programming. 🧠💻🔎
